# Dataset Description

## Introduction

The dataset provides an overview of global energy dynamics. It shows different variables related to energy consumption, production, and environmental impact. For example, the names of several countries across the world,the year the data was recorded for that particular country, population, GDP, biofuel consumption, coal usage, gas consumption, nuclear power, oil consumption, hydropower, low-carbon energy, renewables (solar and wind power), and electricity generation. The dataset also describes diverse metrics such as per capita measures, annual changes, and percentage shares, offering valuable insights in the global use energy. As the OWID site explains, the "complete Energy dataset is a collection of key metrics maintained by Our World in Data. It is updated regularly and includes data on energy consumption (primary energy, per capita, and growth rates), energy mix, electricity mix and other relevant metrics" (Rosado et.al, 2023).
