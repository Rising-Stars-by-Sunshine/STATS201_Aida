# Dataset Description

## Introduction

The dataset provides a comprehensive overview of global energy dynamics, encompassing various variables related to energy consumption, production, and environmental impact. Spanning across countries and years, key aspects include population, GDP, biofuel consumption, coal usage, gas consumption, nuclear power, oil consumption, hydropower, low-carbon energy, renewables (including solar and wind power), and electricity generation. The dataset incorporates diverse metrics such as per capita measures, annual changes, and percentage shares, offering valuable insights into the evolving landscape of energy usage and its implications on both a national and global scale. The "complete Energy dataset is a collection of key metrics maintained by Our World in Data. It is updated regularly and includes data on energy consumption (primary energy, per capita, and growth rates), energy mix, electricity mix and other relevant metrics" (Rosado et.al, 2023).
