# Aida Camacho Ponce de Leon 👩‍💻🌎

Hello, I'm Aida, originally from 🇲🇽 Mexico. I am form the class of 2026 at Duke Kunshan University. My major is Computation & Design with tracks in Social Policy. Academically or professionally speaking, I have a deep passion for 💻📚computational and statistical applications to social science issues, particularly 🌱 environmental policy. I am greatly interested in the intersection between computational and statistical sciences and social science. 

Personally speaking, I find joy in learning new languages and 🌐 connecting with people from diverse parts of the world, embracing various cultures along the way 🌟.

Currently at DKU, I am on a journey to challenge myself academically, socially, and personally.
