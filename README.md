# Content on this Repository

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Here, I am experiencing the world of machine learning and its role in untangling the complexities of real-world issues. In this repository I descibe my research that focuses on *Investigating the Impact of External Factors in Energy Consumption Anomalies Using Machine Learning Algorithms*. As my research delves into the exploration of machine learning methods, it looks to detect anomalies in energy consumption and production as an effect of policy changes. Thus, this repository documents the steps in this process. Namely, it includes various sections covering literature reviews, research idea, sample data, description of the data, and code from data query and visualization process.

## Aida Camacho Ponce de León 👩‍💻🌎

Hi! I'm Aida, originally from 🇲🇽 Mexico. I am form the class of 2026 at Duke Kunshan University. My major is Computation & Design with a track in Social Policy. Academically speaking, I have a deep passion for 💻📚 computational and statistical applications to social science issues, particularly 🌱 environmental policy. I am greatly interested in the intersection between computational and statistical sciences and social science. 

Personally speaking, I find joy in learning new languages and 🌐 connecting with people from diverse parts of the world, embracing various cultures along the way 🌟.

Currently at DKU, I am on a journey to challenge myself academically, socially, and personally.
