# Data Query

## Description

**Step 1**

This section describes the data query and data analysis process.

The data was downloaded from Our World in Data, a scientific online publication focusing on large global problems such as poverty, disease, hunger, climate change, war, existential risks, and inequality (Roser, n.d.). This specific dataset was found under the topic of [Energy](https://ourworldindata.org/energy). The following is the description of the page:

> The world lacks a safe, low-carbon, and cheap large-scale energy infrastructure.
>
> Until we scale up such an energy infrastructure, the world will continue to face two energy problems: hundreds of millions of people lack access to sufficient energy, and the dominance of fossil fuels in our energy system drives climate change and other health impacts such as air pollution.
>
> To ensure everyone has access to clean and safe energy, we need to understand energy consumption and its impacts around the world today and how this has changed over time.
>
> On this page, you can find all our data, visualizations, and writing relating to energy. 
(Rosado, et.al, 2023)

**Step 2**

All code from Our World in Data is open-sourced under the MIT license and can be found on GitHub. Thus, I downloaded the data and codebook directly from their official [Github repository](https://github.com/owid/energy-data/blob/master/README.md).
